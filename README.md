# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.

The site is content-focused, with an emphasis on showcasing my projects and explaining what they do rather than visual effects or heavy frameworks.

## Overview

This portfolio highlights my experiences as well as my projects... many of which were genuinely fun to implement and refine.

Alongside my coursework, I've had the opportunity to grow my software engineering skills through my internship at Aubot, while also developing reliability and customer-facing skills through consistent work experience. 

The projects currently featured include:
- **FreshTrack** — a household inventory system with expiration-aware tracking and forecasting
- **Remote-Controlled Car** — a Raspberry Pi project integrating motors, sensors, and Python control logic

One additional project is nearing completion...
- **Minesweeper FX** — a JavaFX-based application with clean separation of game logic and UI
